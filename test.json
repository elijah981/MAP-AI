'I worked as a lecturer at a university in Gandhinagar where I taught digital topics to engineering <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter>. I had an active <subject_matter id=1>interest</subject_matter> in microcontrollers from my engineering days and I opted to teach the subject and got it easily as many other lecturers disliked this subject altogether. Τhis was the first class I was teaching in this university and thus had to design the <subject_matter id=4>course</subject_matter>, <subject_matter id=2><subject_matter id=4>labs</subject_matter></subject_matter> and <subject_matter id=4>exams</subject_matter> from scratch.\nI started by collecting <subject_matter id=2>material</subject_matter> from the lecturer who undertook this <subject_matter id=4>course</subject_matter> previous year. I found most of the <subject_matter id=2>material</subject_matter> to be suboptimal and outdated and decided to renew all of it. I also <subject_matter id=1>researched</subject_matter> many different styles of <subject_matter id=4>pedagogy</subject_matter> and was greatly <subject_matter id=1>interest</subject_matter>ed in the <subject_matter id=4>flipped classroom method</subject_matter> of teaching. For which I had to prepare very good <subject_matter id=2>material</subject_matter> of <subject_matter id=2>presentations</subject_matter>, collect and sometimes record <subject_matter id=2>videos</subject_matter>, design <subject_matter id=2><subject_matter id=4>labs</subject_matter></subject_matter> that <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> could work on their own.\n\nI made all the <subject_matter id=2>material</subject_matter> available to <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> a week prior to the class. During the class, I would engage with the <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> by asking questions that would direct their learning. I would bring day-to-day examples to explain the concepts of microcontrollers. I assigned groups in the class and <subject_matter id=5>group leaders</subject_matter> to manage the assessing of the homework. I also used to regularly arrange healthy competition between the groups to encourage them to learn faster.\n\nMany times, I would carry <subject_matter id=2>lab <subject_matter id=2>equipment</subject_matter></subject_matter> to the class to do live demonstrations. I customized the <subject_matter id=2><subject_matter id=4>labs</subject_matter></subject_matter> to do <subject_matter id=1>interest</subject_matter>ing <subject_matter id=3>application</subject_matter>s that the <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> could later use as a starting point for their <subject_matter id=2>projects</subject_matter>. I also conducted <subject_matter id=4>workshops</subject_matter> and employed senior <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> as <subject_matter id=4><subject_matter id=5>teaching assistants</subject_matter></subject_matter>. I encouraged the <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> to work on <subject_matter id=2>projects</subject_matter> and add them to their resume. I <subject_matter id=1>guided</subject_matter> many student <subject_matter id=2>projects</subject_matter> ranging from different <subject_matter id=3>application</subject_matter> areas.\n\nFor conducting their <subject_matter id=3>unit tests</subject_matter>, I formed a <subject_matter id=3>multiple-choice questionnaire</subject_matter>. I made them to fill their <subject_matter id=3>answers</subject_matter> in a OMR (optical mark recognition) sheet. Since the university didn’t have the <subject_matter id=2>equipment</subject_matter> to evaluate such sheets, I designed an <subject_matter id=3>application</subject_matter> to evaluate the <subject_matter id=2>scanned copies</subject_matter> automatically. This greatly reduced the time to evaluate their <subject_matter id=3>scores</subject_matter>. Hence, I was able to conduct such tests multiple times without putting much effort.\n\nWhen the semester ended, in the last class the <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> gave me a standing ovation and wrote many letters <subject_matter id=1>appreciating</subject_matter> my hard work. Many of them still contact me for advice with their careers.\nI loved to prepare the <subject_matter id=2>material</subject_matter> and <subject_matter id=4>lectures</subject_matter> for the class. I <subject_matter id=1>enjoyed</subject_matter> searching for new and innovative ways to teach and engage with the <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter>. I was <subject_matter id=1>happy</subject_matter> to see many of the <subject_matter id=5>students</subject_matter> learning not just the subject but also developing a love for engineering. I was very <subject_matter id=1>proud</subject_matter> when they appreciated my hard work and used to talk well about me.'
